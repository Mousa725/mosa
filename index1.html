<h1 style="font-style: oblique;"><u>Establishment and start of the club :</u></h1>
<p><h2><mark> idea of establishing :</mark>  <b><h3>Al-Ahly</b>Al-Ahly came in the first 10 years of the 20th century and was firstly raised by <b> Omar Lotfy </b> ,<br>
     who was a student in the Egyptian Law School during his presidency of the High School Students Club.<br>
      The establishment of a club for high school students was for political reasons along with the students needing a sports<br>
       club for them to gather for leisure and exercise.

He discussed the idea of establishing the club with a group of friends who were enthusiastic about it and in 1907, Al Ahly was established.[4]
</h3></h2>
</p><h2>Talaat Harb, president of the Bank of  Egypt, contributed £E100 to the establishment of the club.

      <h2>In the summer of 1929, Al-Ahly's football went on a tour where the team traveled to face several European clubs, such as Fenerbahçe and Galatasaray in Turkey and BFC Preussen, 1860 Munich and Schalke in Germany. The tour ended with Al Ahly playing the last two games in Bulgaria against Levski Sofia and Slavia Sofia. In November 1930, Al-Ahly defeated rival Zamalek 4–0 in a match in the Cairo League. In that game, Mokhtar El Tetsh was the first player to score a hat trick in the Cairo Derby. At the end of the 1936–1937 season, Al Ahly managed to win the league in the last round by defeating Zamalek 4–1, finishing three points ahead of their rivals. The club won the King Farouk Cup with a 3–2 victory over El Sekka El Hadid SC. In 1938, Al Ahly won the last version of the Sultan Hussein Cup, with a 1–0 victory over Al Masry in the final match. The club won the Cairo League, again in the last round, with a 5–1 victory over the second placed Zamalek.
The team traveled to Mandatory Palestine in 1943 on a 23-day tour, headed by Mokhtar El Tetsh, to play several matches with Arab teams to support Palestine against the Zionists. The decision had been made despite the refusal of the president of the Egyptian Football Association Haider Pasha, due to the pressure from the British position against the Palestinian issue.
